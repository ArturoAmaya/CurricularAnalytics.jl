# CurricularAnalytics
CurricularAnalytics.jl is a toolbox for analyzing the complexity of academic program curricula.  The toolbox represenats curricula as graphs, allowing various graph-theoretic measures to be applied in order to quantify the complexity of curricula. 
In addition to analyzing curricular complexity, the toolbox supports the ability to visualize curricula, to create optimal degree plans the satisfy particular constraints, and to simulate the impact of various events on student progression through a curriculum.
